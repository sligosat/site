     CanSat is an engineering competition sponsored and set up by AMD. You have to build a satellite inside of a 330ml Coke can to gather information in low atmosphere. We have to complete a primary and secondary mission for the competition. The primary mission is to measure air temperature, altitude and establish a radio connection to transmit that data and other data to a ground computer.
   </p><br><p>
We have used the Arduino microcontroller and a daughter board with the BME280 sensor to measure the air temperature and altitude to complete the primary mission. We used C++ to control the arduino to follow certain instructions.
    </p><br><p>
We created a certain ground station through python to take all the data we measure and import it to excel as well as plotting graphs automatically for ease of use. 
 </p><br><p>
We created a website through replit using html to create a ground up website to show an extra layer of depth. It shows all our progress and goals to date.
 </p><br><p>
We created a twitter and Instagram account to increase our social presence and show our progress to the public
 </p><br><p>
We have had 2 workshops in Athlone to gain help and advice for our project. The first of which was to finish the primary mission of the project and the second of which was to set our radio frequencies and see our progress.
 </p><br><p>
The can design was created by trying to keep everything simple and functional so it had 66mm diameter and 115mm height with a hinge.
 </p><br><p>
We went to the regional finals on the 4th of March with no can and no working radios. But when we got to TUS Athlone we swapped our radios to radios on the same frequency. Then got our radio frequency just brought up on the drone and measured the data. Then for one last push we created a masterful presentation that was carried out elegantly. We were able to move on to nationals. One of the major reasons our presentation was better than others is that the data we plotted on graphs made sense as our graphs had a u shape that shows variation and other teams had data that went in a straight line that shows that their sensors didnâ€™t work.
